# vim-fzy-common

Fuzzy-select buffers, tags, help tags, and `oldfiles` using the fuzzy-searcher
[fzy][fzy].

vim-fzy-common is an extension for [vim-fzy][vim-fzy] that provides commands for
quickly navigating to listed buffers, `oldfiles`, tags generated by `ctags`, as
well as Vim's internal help tags.


## Usage

| Command     | Description                                                           |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Buffer`    | List buffers (like `:ls`), edit selected buffer in current window.    |
| `SBuffer`\* | Same as `Buffer`, but edit the selected buffer in a new split.        |
| `MRUedit`   | List Most-Recently-Used files, edit selected file in current window.  |
| `MRUsplit`\*| Same as `MRUedit`, but edit the selected file in a new split.         |
| `Tjump`     | List all tags, jump to selected tag in current window.                |
| `STjump`\*  | Same as `Tjump`, but jump to the selected tag in a new split.         |
| `Help`\*    | List all help tags, open help page with the selected tag in new split.|

\* Commands that split the current window accept a command modifier. For
example, to open the help page with the selected tag in a new vertical split,
run `:vertical Help`. `:tab MRUsplit` will open the selected file in a new tab.

For a full list of supported command modifiers, see `:help fzy-:SBuffer`.
