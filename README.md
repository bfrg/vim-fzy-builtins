# vim-fzy-common

Fuzzy-select buffers, files in `arglist`, tags, help tags, and `oldfiles` using
the fuzzy-searcher [fzy][fzy].

vim-fzy-common is an extension for [vim-fzy][vim-fzy] that provides commands for
quickly navigating to listed buffers, files in the argument list, `oldfiles`,
tags generated by `ctags`, as well as Vim's help tags.


## Usage

| Command     | Description                                                           |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Buffer`    | List buffers, edit selected buffer in current window.                 |
| `SBuffer`\* | Same as `Buffer`, but edit the selected buffer in a new split.        |
| `Args`      | Print global `arglist`, edit selected file in current window.         |
| `SArgs`\*   | Same as `Args`, but edit the selected file in a new split.            |
| `Largs`     | Print local `arglist`, edit selected file in current window.          |
| `SLargs`\*  | Same as `Largs`, but edit the selected file in a new split.           |
| `MRUedit`   | List Most-Recently-Used files, edit selected file in current window.  |
| `MRUsplit`\*| Same as `MRUedit`, but edit the selected file in a new split.         |
| `Tjump`     | List all tags, jump to selected tag in current window.                |
| `STjump`\*  | Same as `Tjump`, but jump to the selected tag in a new split.         |
| `Help`\*    | List all help tags, open help page with the selected tag in new split.|

\*Commands that split the current window accept a **command modifier**. For
example, to open the help page with the selected tag in a new vertical split,
run `:vertical Help`. `:tab MRUsplit` will open the selected file in a new tab.

For a full list of supported command modifiers, see `:help fzy-:SBuffer`.

## Tips and Tricks

#### Custom commands

If you prefer shorter Ex commands, add the following to your `vimrc`:
```vim
command! ME MRUedit
command! MS MRUsplit
command! MV vertical MRUsplit
command! MT tab MRUsplit
```
The command names are inspired by [vim-tinyMRU][tinymru].

#### Mappings

If you prefer mappings over Ex commands, you might find the following useful:
```vim
" Jump between listed buffers
nnoremap <silent> <leader>be :<c-u>Buffer<cr>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>bs :<c-u>SBuffer<cr>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>bv :<c-u>vertical SBuffer<cr>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>bt :<c-u>tab SBuffer<cr>

" Quickly edit oldfiles
nnoremap <silent> <leader>me :<c-u>MRUedit<cr>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>ms :<c-u>MRUsplit<cr>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>mv :<c-u>vertical MRUsplit<cr>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>mt :<c-u>tab MRUsplit<cr>

" Quickly jump to tag location
nnoremap <silent> <leader>te :<c-u>Tjump<cr>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>ts :<c-u>STjump<cr>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>tv :<c-u>vertical STjump<cr>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>tt :<c-u>tab STjump<cr>

" Quickly open help pages
nnoremap <silent> <leader>hh :<c-u>Help<cr>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>hv :<c-u>vertical Help<cr>
nnoremap <silent> <leader>ht :<c-u>tab Help<cr>
```
