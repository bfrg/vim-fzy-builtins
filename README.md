# vim-fzy-common

Fuzzy-select buffers, tags, help tags, and `oldfiles`.

vim-fzy-common is an extension for [vim-fzy][vim-fzy] that provides commands for
quickly navigating to listed buffers, `oldfiles`, tags generated by `ctags`, as
well as Vim's internal help tags.


## Usage

| Command     | Description                                                               |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Buffer`    | List buffers (like `:ls`), edit selected buffer in current window.        |
| `SBuffer`\* | List buffers (like `:ls`), edit selected buffer in new split.             |
| `ME`        | List most-recently-used files, edit selected file in current window.      |
| `MS`\*      | List most-recently-used files, edit selected file in new split.           |
| `Tjump`     | List tags, edit file containing selected tag in current window.           |
| `STjump`\*  | List tags, edit file containing selected tag in new split.                |
| `Help`\*    | List help tags, open help page containing the selected tag in new split.  |

\* Commands that split the current window accept a command modifier. For
example, to open the help page with the selected tag in a new vertical split,
run `:vert Help`. `:tab MS` will open the selected file in a new tab.

For a full list of supported command modifiers, see `:help <mods>`.
